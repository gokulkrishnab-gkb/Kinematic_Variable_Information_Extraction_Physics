# Kinematic_Variable_Information_Extraction_Physics
--------------------------------------------------------
Development Stage
--------------------------------------------------------

The Script is to extract kinematic variable information of interest event by event and save it to a csv file.
--------------------------------------------------------
The File should be saved inside the examples folder in the Delphes and the user should come back to Delphes folder location in terminal before running the script. <br/> 
To run the script follow: <br/> 
root -l examples/particle_extract.C'("/home/kousik/Madgraph/MG5_aMC_v3_1_1/zz_jjjj_events_enhanced/Events/run_01/tag_1_delphes_events.root")' \\ need to modifie based on the local repository.
